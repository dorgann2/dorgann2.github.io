    <h1>Scholarship Application Overhaul</h1>

    <p>At one point in one of my college courses we were given the task to upgrade
      an old ASP.net application from .Net 2.0 to .Net 6.0, as well as fix a variety of
      bugs that were plaguing the application.
    </p>

    <p>I worked on this project with a team and my task was primarily to upgrade
      the application to .Net 6. I was able to successfully upgrade the application
      to the new framework and we also found a number of bugs in the application along
      the way. There were issues with the page crashing when certain variables were null
      and there were other minor bugs that we found and fixed.
    </p>

    <p>For privacy and copywrite reasons I will not be including any code snippets
      or pictures of this specific application.
    </p>
